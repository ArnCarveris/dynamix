## DynaMix Performance Tests

*Using a copy of [picobench](https://github.com/iboB/picobench)*

The performance tests are not built as part of the main build because the mutation performance test requires an additional ~400k source file which is generated by a script and not part of the repo.

To build the performance tests, you need to manually execute `generate.rb` in `mutation_perf/` with a Ruby interpreter and then call cmake with ` -DDYNAMIX_BUILD_PERF=1`
